things to do -

Problem Solving:
- Draw.io a flow chart of what I'd do to implement ActionCable, ie break down the components and what i'd work on first..

Programme Fluently:
- Film me doing a process workshop task. Make sure there's no flailing and you know what to do next.

Refactor anything:
- Go back and refactor a file in one of my repos.
- Do Bank and then refactor out into separate classes.




- Find commit history and the merge requests for MakersBnB, how we approved each others' branches.
- Find evidence that Henry and Sam were able to use my back end work...
